    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/3 cup BBQ sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fresh squeezed lemon juice (optional)</li>
        <li>2-4 teaspoons sriracha*</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon yellow mustard</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>Cracked black pepper , to taste (optional)</li>
        <li>3-4 pounds (or 1 1/2kg to 2kg) whole chicken (Butterflied is preferred)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to season</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Procedures</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>When ready to cook, arrange oven shelf to the middle of the oven, and preheat to 470째F | 245째C.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the refrigerator and let it sit on a bench top for 20 minutes, or just enough time to take the chill out of the chicken. (I find 20 minutes plenty of time. Don't leave it any longer than half an hour at room temperature.)</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in an oven proof pan or well seasoned skillet over medium heat. When pan is hot, place the chicken, breast-side down into the pan, and sear for a good 5-6 minutes, until the skin becomes golden browned. Flip and sear on the other side for a further 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 2 more tablespoons of vegetable oil to the remaining marinade, and pour half of it over the chicken. Use a basting brush to coat evenly.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken in the preheated oven, and cook for 20 minutes. Reduce heat down to 400째F (200째C) and roast for a further 35-40 minutes, or until cooked right through to the centre and juices run clear.</li>
        <li>Place chicken on well-greased grill over medium heat, skin-side down, for 10-12 minutes, until the skin begins to have a nice char on it. Add 2 more tablespoons of vegetable oil to the remaining marinade. Flip and baste with a small amount of sauce (not too much or it will burn on your grill plates). Close barbecue lid and cook for 40-45 minutes, flipping once or twice while cooking, until chicken is completely cooked through and juices run clear.</li>
